    Pethowz connects pet owners with service providers, especially pet hosts for home boarding, and kennel based boarding and various services for pets like Pet grooming, pet walking, pet training etc. Pethows provides a web-based and app-based platform to find cageless boarding and pet services based on location, cost and availability. </p>

<p>Cageless Boarding:  The core focus area is about cageless boarding where pet owners can leave their pets in other pet owners or pet hosts house. Pet owners would have a choice of professional, semi professional but passionate pet hosts to choose from especially residential spaces or professional pet boarding spots.</p>

<p>Affordable and Luxury Stays: Pet boarding has become a very costly affair and also pet owners are looking for premier services too. So, focus would be to provide both affordable and also high end or luxury stays so that it caters to these diverse audiences. (in simple terms an Airbnb for Pets)</p>

<p>KYC - Verified and Qualified Registrants: Pethows would verify qualified listings by phone authentication, google authentication, facebook authentication, physical visit etc to ensure customer happiness eventually.</p>
